Package: R.filesets
===================

Version: 0.5.3 [2009-08-12]
o Now findByName() of GenericDataFileSet follows Windows Shortcut 
  links also for subdirectories.


Version: 0.5.2 [2009-06-08]
o Analogously to the method for a GenericDataFile, the 
  setFullNameTranslator() method for GenericDataFileSet now
  assumes that the fullname translator function accepts also
  argument 'set'.
o Added argument '.fileSetClass' to GenericDataFileSet().


Version: 0.5.1 [2009-05-19]
o A fullname translator function for a GenericDataFile should accept
  any number of arguments.  The first argument will always be 
  (an unnamed) argument containing the name (or names) to be 
  translated.  If the translator is for a GenericDataFile, an
  additional argument 'file' will also be passed.  This allows
  the translator function to for instance read the file header
  and infer the name that way.


Version: 0.5.0 [2009-05-17]
o Extracted several classes and methods from the aroma.core package.
o Created package.
