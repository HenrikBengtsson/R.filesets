Package: R.filesets
===================

Version: 0.6.5 [2009-10-30]
o ROBUSTIFICATION: Now translateFullName() of FullNameInterface 
  and translateColumnNames() of GenericTabularFile throw an 
  exception if some fullnames were translated into NA.  They
  also assert that no names were dropped or added in the process.
o BUG FIX: After doing append() to a GenericDataFileSet, the
  total file size reported would remain the same.
o BUG FIX: Appending empty data sets using append() of GenericDataFileSet
  would give error Error in this$files[[1]] : subscript out of bounds.


Version: 0.6.4 [2009-10-25]
o Added get- and setExtensionPattern() to FullNameInterface.
o Added getExtension() to GenericDataFile.


Version: 0.6.3 [2009-10-23]
o Added appendFullNameTranslatorBylist() which makes it possible to do
  setup a sequence of fullnames translators fnt1, fnt2, fnt3 by calling
  setFullNameTranslator(..., list(fnt1, fnt2, fnt3)).


Version: 0.6.2 [2009-10-22]
o Added support for having a sequence of fullname translator 
  functions.  These can be added using appendFullNameTranslator().
o Added an example() to FullNameInterface.


Version: 0.6.1 [2009-10-06]
o Added subsetting via [() to TabularTextFile.


Version: 0.6.0 [2009-10-02]
o Added the FullNameInterface, which is the interface class that
  defines what fullnames, names, tags etc are.
o Now setFullName*s*Translator() for GenericDataFileSet dispatches 
  on the 'by' argument.  If that is not possible, it call 
  setFullNameTranslator() for each file in the set (as before).
o CLEAN UP: Renamed fromFiles() to byPath().  For backward 
  compatibility the former calls the latter. 
o CLEAN UP: GenericDataFile and GenericDataFileSet implements
  the FullNameInterface, which mean less redundant code.


Version: 0.5.3 [2009-08-12]
o Now findByName() of GenericDataFileSet follows Windows Shortcut 
  links also for subdirectories.


Version: 0.5.2 [2009-06-08]
o Analogously to the method for a GenericDataFile, the 
  setFullNameTranslator() method for GenericDataFileSet now
  assumes that the fullname translator function accepts also
  argument 'set'.
o Added argument '.fileSetClass' to GenericDataFileSet().


Version: 0.5.1 [2009-05-19]
o A fullname translator function for a GenericDataFile should accept
  any number of arguments.  The first argument will always be 
  (an unnamed) argument containing the name (or names) to be 
  translated.  If the translator is for a GenericDataFile, an
  additional argument 'file' will also be passed.  This allows
  the translator function to for instance read the file header
  and infer the name that way.


Version: 0.5.0 [2009-05-17]
o Extracted several classes and methods from the aroma.core package.
o Created package.
